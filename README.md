## 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm currently contributing to the internal **ERP system** of **SOMIK SPA**, where I design and develop full-stack modules for the Commercial, Technical, and Procurement departments. My focus: making complex workflows smoother, smarter, and more efficient.

On the side, I'm building a specialized web application for an optical store 🕶️ — drawing from two years of experience in the optical industry.

**Current tech stack**:
- 🐍 Flask (modular architecture with role-based access control)
- 🐘 PostgreSQL & MySQL
- 🎨 HTML / CSS / Bootstrap
- 📊 Data analysis & reporting tools
